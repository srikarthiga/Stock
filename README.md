The stock market is a highly dynamic and complex system influenced by numerous factors. Forecasting stock prices accurately is a challenging but essential task for investors and financial analysts. This project explores the application of classical time series models — ARIMA and SARIMA — alongside modern techniques like Facebook Prophet and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting daily stock prices. The dataset consists of historical daily closing prices of [Stock Name], spanning [Start Date] to [End Date]. Each model’s strengths and limitations are discussed, with evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) used to assess predictive accuracy. A Streamlit-based interactive application is developed to visualize forecasts and facilitate real-time decision making. Results indicate that hybrid approaches incorporating both statistical and deep learning models offer improved accuracy and robustness in volatile markets
